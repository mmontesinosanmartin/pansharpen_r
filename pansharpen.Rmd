# Pansharpening

Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed by the amount of techniques devoted to 
processing satellite imagery. This tutorial is an attempt to summarize
and orgnize these techniques from an `R`-user perspective. This means
that the tutorial explains methods  available in `R` (either native or
available through third-party software). Hence, the tutorial is not
a comprehensive review of all the techniques, but only those existing

Here we address \textbf{pansharpening} methods, which is a group of
techniques intended to increase the spatial and spectral resolution of
satellite  images by fusing images with complementary features. The
tutorial gives:

 - An introduction to the basics  of pansharpening in Section 1.
 - An overview of methods in Section 2.
 - Explanations about the methods in Section 3, with:
   - Brief theoretical explanations of each method. 
   - Simple and reproducible examples. 

## Basics

Pansharpening methods generally fuse a panchromatic image with a multi-
or hyper-spectral image:

  - A \textbf{panchromatic} (PAN) image is an image with a high spatial
  detail. Instruments retrieving PAN images capture broader bandwidths,
  which increase the signal-to-noise ratio. However, this hampers the
  differentiation of intensities at different wavelengths. Hence, they 
  are generally presented as gray-scale images.

  - \textbf{Multi- and hyper-spectral} images carry information from
  narrower wavelengths. The difference between multi and hyper-spectral
  depends on the number of bands (tens vs. hundreds) and how narrow the
  bandwidths are. Because their signal-to-noise ratio is lower, spectral
  resolution comes at the cost of spatial resolution.
